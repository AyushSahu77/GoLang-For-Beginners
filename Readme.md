Download Go packages, available for all OSs at [GoDownload]

Open _terminal_ and run the below caommand to check that the installation process was succesful

Open your favourite editor

Create a Go file using syntax

```
Sample code :

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello World!")

P.S. 

Used IDE : Visual Studio on MacOS Monterey 12.6

Go Version : go1.19.2 (Visit Go documentation below to know more about versions and compatibility)

File names are simple as I had to write filenames at terminal to run the file
